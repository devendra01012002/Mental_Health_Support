    <h3>What is mental health and why is it important?</h3> 
Behavioral health (sometimes called mental health) includes a person’s psychological, emotional and social wellbeing. It shapes the way you think, feel, behave and interact with others. Your mental state also affects how you cope with stress. It’s a vital part of your life, from infancy through adulthood.
<h3>What is a mental health disorder?</h3>

Mental (behavioral) health disorders, or mental illnesses, affect the way you think and behave. They change your mood and can make it difficult to function at home, work, school or in your community.

It’s important to note that having poor mental health doesn’t always mean you have a behavioral health disorder. You can also have a behavioral health disorder and still go through long periods of good mental health.

<h3>Are there different types of mental health disorders?</h3>
There are more than 200 types of mental health disorders. A few of the most common types of mental health disorders include:

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
Substance use disorders, including drug addiction and alcohol use disorder.

Anyone of any age, sex, background or ethnicity can get a behavioral health disorder. People designated female at birth (DFAB) more commonly experience depression, anxiety and eating disorders. While people designated male at birth (DMAB) are more likely to experience substance abuse and antisocial personality disorders.

Diagnosis and Tests
How are mental health disorders diagnosed?
It’s important to get a diagnosis from a healthcare provider who specializes in behavioral health disorders. You need an accurate diagnosis to receive the right treatment.

A healthcare provider will carefully review your symptoms to evaluate your mental health. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider:

If there are any specific triggers that make your mental health worse.
If your mental health problems are chronic (ongoing) or if they come and go.
When you first noticed changes in your mental health.
There aren’t any medical tests that can diagnose mental illnesses. But your healthcare provider may perform tests, such as blood work or imaging exams, to rule out other conditions that can affect mental health.

Management and Treatment
How are mental health disorders treated?
Treatments for mental health disorders may include:

Medication: Some mental illnesses respond well to medication, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. These medicines change the chemicals in your brain, so you experience fewer symptoms. It’s very important to take medication exactly as your healthcare provider directs. Never stop taking medication for a mental illness without consulting your healthcare provider.
Psychotherapy: Talking to a mental health professional can help you work through the challenges of an illness and manage its symptoms. Psychotherapy can be in a one-to-one setting with a healthcare provider or a group setting. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy. It focuses on helping you change negative behaviors and thought patterns.
Alternative therapies: Some mental illnesses, such as depression, may improve with alternative therapies. Examples include herbal remedies, massage, acupuncture, yoga and meditation. Talk to your healthcare provider before taking any herbal remedies or supplements. They may affect other medications.
Brain stimulation therapies: Not all disorders improve with medication. If that’s the case, your healthcare provider may recommend brain stimulation therapies. These treatments change the way nerves and other cells in your brain process chemicals and respond to stimuli. Examples include electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
Prevention
Are behavioral health disorders preventable?
There’s no way to prevent a behavioral health disorder. But you can manage symptoms better with the help of a healthcare provider. Contact them as soon as you notice there’s a problem.

Outlook / Prognosis
What’s the prognosis (outlook) for people with a behavioral health disorder?
Most people with behavioral health disorders can manage their symptoms. They lead full, fulfilling lives with the right treatments. Some people will need to manage a mental illness for the rest of their lives. Others find that symptoms improve as they get older. Overall, mental illnesses tend to peak in young adults ages 18 to 25, then diminish greatly after 50. Mental illness can also increase your risk for certain health conditions such as stroke, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
